2013FinalRobotCode
==================

Final code for FRC Team 3925's robot TazBot (unofficially BadwinBot)

### Project Structure

We are using command based robot on the following subsytems:

| Subsystem: | Commands:             |
|------------|-----------------------|
|Drive       |DriveControl           |
|------------|-----------------------|
|Launcher    |Auto, LauncherControl  |
|------------|-----------------------|
|Tilt        |TiltControl            |

### RobotControls

We are controlling our robot using two xbox controllers: one for the driver and one for the shooter. The triggers on the shooter controller control the launcher, the 'a' button the shooter controller shoots the disc, the bumpers on the shooter controller control the tilt of the launcher and the two joysticks on the driver controller control the driver train (halo style).
